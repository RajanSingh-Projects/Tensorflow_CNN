# Tensorflow_CNN
This is an implementation of various Neural Networks from simple single-layer Neural Network to Convolutional Neural Network achieving around 99% accuracy. The Neural Networks are implementated using TensorFlow and trained on MNIST handwritten digits dataset. The dependencies can be found in requirements.txt file and can be installed using the follwing command:  
pip install tensorflow  
  
This implementation will only work on Unix-like operating systems with Python 2.7 and not on Windows systems. Although, you can tweak to make it happen.  
PS: Sorry for Windows users as I'm not much familiar with Windows.
