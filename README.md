# Tensorflow_CNN
This is an implementation of various Neural Networks from simple single-layer Neural Network to Convolutional Neural Network achieving around 99% accuracy. The Neural Networks are implementated using TensorFlow and trained on MNIST handwritten digits dataset. The dependencies can be found in requirements.txt file and can be installed via pip except Anaconda which can only be installed by excuting script.sh file.
You can also install all dependencies by simply executing script.sh.
This implementation will only work on Unix-like operating systems. Although, you can tweak to make it happen.
PS: Sorry for Windows users as I'm not much familiar with Windows.
